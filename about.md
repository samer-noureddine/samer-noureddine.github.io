My name is Samer, I am pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Science at Tufts University. I am interested in the processes that are going on in your brain right now, as your eyes make sense of these words - the processes that make comprehension not only possible, but impressively fast and nearly effortless. I use this blog to summarize interesting concepts in computational cognitive science as they cross my path.
